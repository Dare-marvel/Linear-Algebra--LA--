Imagine you are a chemical engineer working with a reaction that involves three reactants, A, B, and C, D which turn into two product, E. You conducted three experiments, and in each of them, you varied the amounts of A, B, and C, D. Your goal now is to find out the stoichiometric coefficients (i.e., the proportion in which these reactants combine) for the balanced chemical equation. 
    
The general form of the chemical reaction is:  
aA + bB + cC + dD â†’ eE 


Here, a, b, c, d, e  are the stoichiometric coefficients we aim to find.

c=3,-3,2,-4
d=-1,-1,3,3
